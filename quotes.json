What is important, what bullwhips you, what drives you, what torments you, is that you must find some way of using this to connect you with everyone else alive. Its all you have to do with it. You must understand your pain is trivial except insofar as you can use it to connect with other people's pain, and insofar as you can do that with your pain, you can be released from it and then hopefully, it works the other way around too. Insofar as I can tell you what it is like to suffer, perhaps I can help you suffer less."

In the interval between reach and grasp, between glance and counterglance, between 'I love you' and 'I love you too,' the absent presence of desire comes alive. But the boundaries of time and glance and I love you are only aftershocks of the main, inevitable boundary that creates Eros: the boundary of flesh and self between you and me. And it is only, suddenly, at the moment when I would dissolve that boundary, I realize I never can."

The tiniest twigs no bigger than a tom-tit’s claw are encrusted with an infinity of little crystals scintillating and dazzling. The original little bough is no longer recognizable; it has become a child’s plaything very pretty to see. When the sun is shining and the air is perfectly dry the miners of Hallein seize the opportunity of offering these diamond-studded boughs to travellers preparing to go down to the mine"
